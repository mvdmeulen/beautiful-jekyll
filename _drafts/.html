<blockquote><p>Arjenâ€™s PhD-project is about urban neighbourhoods in which relatively high concentrations of â€˜illegal immigrantsâ€™ reside. On the one hand Arjen tries to explain the way in which illegal immigrants are spatially spread. On the other hand, Arjen is interested in extent to which - and the conditions under which - the presence of illegal immigrants is related to the â€˜securityâ€™ (victimization and fear of crime) that is experienced by residents of these neighbourhoods.  Particularly, Arjen will research whether there is evidence for the so-called â€˜marginalisation thesisâ€™, which claims that the more â€˜restrictiveâ€™ Dutch policies with respect to illegal immigration and residence have heightened the prevalence of offences amongst illegal immigrants. Arjen makes use of quantitative (national police data, secondary analysis of data from the â€˜Politiemonitor Bevolkingâ€™) as well as qualitative (interviews, examination of criminal files) research methods.</p></blockquote>
