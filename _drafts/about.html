<h4>more me</h4>
<p>At the moment (2006) i am busy starting up a new project titled â€œThe Participation of Immigrant Churches in Dutch Civil Societyâ€. In the Netherlands there are around 1200 immigrant churches, and 800.000 immigrants (presumably) having a Christian background. Up till now this group of immigrants has been neglected in scienitific and public debates on immigration and religion.</p>
<p>Recently I finished a PhD study titled "Church and civil society in a new suburb". My research is based on (mostly) etnographic fieldwork in <a href="http://www.leidscherijn.nl">Leidsche Rijn</a>, the largest new VINEX building project in the Netherlands. During the year 2002 I followed two church-building projects, an ecumenical project called "Being Church in Leidsche Rijn" and a conservative reformed project, called <a href="http://www.rijnwaarde.nl">RijnWaarde</a>. My PhD-thesis will be published in May 2006.</p>
