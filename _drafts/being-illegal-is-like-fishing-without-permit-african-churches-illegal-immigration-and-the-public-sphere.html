<p><em>Introduction<br />
</em></p>
<p>The issue of immigration is one of the <em>hot issues</em> in the Dutch public sphere. Until the nineties reference to problems related to immigration was considered politically incorrect, but recently it has become one of the main topics of discussion. One important focus is the issue of illegal immigration. In the Netherlands there are between 50.000 and 200.000 undocumented immigrants (Ederveen et al. 2005; Engbersen et al. 2002; Tinnemans 2005). African churches are directly involved in this issue. Although there is no statistical data available, experts in the field estimate that 30 percent of the members of these churches does not have proper papers for legal residence. The main question I want to explore in this article is what position African churches have in the debate on illegal immigration in the public sphere. Do African churches participate in discussions on the subject? What is their view on illegal migration? What is the value of their contribution to the debate?</p>
<p>To answer my research questions I need to describe the general discussion on the issue of illegal immigration. It is nearly impossible to give a detailed overview of the whole discussion within the scope of this article, so I will limit myself to a summary of the debate in the major Dutch public media of the last two years. For this summary I have used several online sources, such as the <em>Krantenbank</em>, the proceedings of the chambers of Parliament, and (radio-)documentaries available at <em>uitzendinggemist.nl</em>. The discussions in these media are reasonably representative of the whole debate. After this exposition I will present the position of African churches. The material for this presentation is based on interviews with pastors of African churches, mostly from the Amsterdam area, and with representatives of religiously motivated social initiatives that regularly deal with undocumented migrants, such as the <em>Voedselbank</em> ("Foodbank") and the Don Bosco Centre for youth work, both located in Amsterdam Zuidoost. The religious backgrounds of the respondents are diverse: Roman Catholic, Baptist, Methodist, African Methodist Episcopal, Presbyterian, and Pentecostal. I also use information from experts in the field, such as a pastor connected with the <em>Afrikahuis</em> ("Africa House") and workers of the IOM Netherlands, a non-governmental organisation that helps migrants to return to their home country. In this article I have deliberately chosen to focus on persons who are active in the public sphere, although preliminary findings of the research project "The Participation of Immigrant Churches in Dutch Civil Society" suggest that not many African churches participate in the public sphere (De Vries 2006). Problems of survival (e.g. finding and funding a place of worship), a theology that focuses on personal piety, and a "closed" social market (e.g. several venues to participation are already occupied by the 'established' churches) seem to hinder a public presence of African churches. A research that focuses on a-typical participants may not be representative for all African churches; my aim is not to be comprehensive but to give insight in the how of participating in the public sphere. One last methodological caveat: to keep things simple I often use African churches as if this is a uniform group, although of course there are many different viewpoints on the issue between churches and even within churches.</p>
<p>
Â </p>
<p><em>Concepts<br />
</em></p>
<p>With public participation I mean participation in the project of a whole society, in this case the Dutch society, of "coming to a common mind" (Taylor 2004, 1995). This process takes places in the public sphere, the place were participants publicly discuss ideas and practices, for example in newspapers and other media.</p>
<p>In this article I use "undocumented" and "illegal". Both adjectives have the same meaning, but "illegal" suggest that having no legal papers for residence is a criminal activity, which is not (yet) the case in the Netherlands. I therefore prefer to use the word undocumented, but I use "illegal immigration" and not "undocumented immigration" as this is an uncommon phrase.</p>
<p>Illegal immigration is often thought as a singular, uniform phenomenon. In reality, there are a number of different ways of being illegal. Some people do not have the right papers to stay in the Netherlands, e.g. people who came on a tourist visa and who stayed after the expiration date. There are also people who are allowed to stay, but not to work, e.g. people who work while their tourist visa is valid. Of course there are also people who are neither allowed to stay or work. Engbersen et al. (2002) distinguish three waves of immigration: (1) the immigration of Turkish and Moroccan "guest workers" in the fifties, sixties and seventies of the 20th century, (2) the asylum migration in the eighties and nineties, and (3) the recent work migration, mostly from Middle and Eastern Europe and Africa. All three waves have their illegal counterparts, e.g. asylum seekers who stay after their request for asylum is rejected, or workers from new European Union countries who take jobs in areas of work they are not allowed to work in. Most of the African undocumented migrants belong to the third wave. They have come to the Netherlands from the nineties onwards, and are often not eligible for asylum requests because their home countries are considered safe. The majority of Dutch Africans come from West Africa, especially Ghana.</p>
<p>Illegal immigration became an issue in the early nineties. Earlier, the existence of illegal residents was largely ignored. Illegal work was treated mildly: up to 1991 it was possible for undocumented immigrants to receive a fiscal number and to work (more or less) legally, although their stay was illegal. During the nineties people began to realise that a large number of immigrant workers weren't going back to their country of origin. Gradually the immigration laws became increasingly firm. In the same process, illegal immigration came to be seen as a problem:</p>
<p>
Â </p>
<p>"At first, people were seen as spontaneous labourers and now they are more and more perceived as people who breach the laws and are also associated with crime." (Van der Leun, quoted in: Bakker 2005).</p>
<p>
Â </p>
<p>Although the strict laws make life for undocumented immigrants more difficult, there are a number of ways to survive. Family support is the most important resource for undocumented migrants. Relatives help undocumented migrants find housing, work, food etc. Usually the presence of family is the major reason to go to a certain country. Often the family in the country of destination is the initiator and financial supporter of the migration process. Ethnic networks, such as ethnic churches, are another source of support. There are several indications that African churches are an important part of the survival networks of undocumented immigrants from Africa. Experts in the field estimate that 30% of the members of African churches are undocumented, although this figure can vary greatly from church to church. Some churches see helping undocumented Africans as an important part of their mission, and may have a much higher percentage of undocumented members. The percentage also varies from time to time. African immigrants travel a lot between European Union countries: they go where the prospects for finding jobs and legal papers are best. For example, in 2005 and 2006 many left for Spain and Great Britain.</p>
<p>African churches provide undocumented immigrants with various forms of support. Sometimes church buildings are used as sleeping places, but more often congregations function as a place to find people who are willing to provide housing for an undocumented immigrant. African churches are concentrations of capital, providing documented and undocumented immigrants with information on and access to job opportunities. African churches also function as an in-between space: a place situated between the old and the new home that recreates the life that the immigrant has left, a 'home away from home'. As such it serves as a site for "establishing alternative identities" (Guest 2003). In the church someone can be not some anonymous illegal but a respected member or even leader of a community.</p>
<p>
Â </p>
<p><em>The public discussion on undocumented immigrants<br />
</em></p>
<p>Broadly speaking there exist two opposed views in the public debate on illegal immigration. The first position is what I call the "procedural approach". The goal is in this approach is to execute the rules fair . In accordance with European policy (cf. Munster 2004) illegal immigration is seen as a criminal activity that has to be battled with a strict policy of tracking undocumented immigrants, making life difficult for them by cutting access to resources (e.g. schooling, health care) and sending undocumented immigrants as soon as possible back to the country of origin. In this position immigration is coupled to integration. New immigrants in the Netherlands need to integrate in Dutch society: they need to learn the language and habits of its native residents. This focus on integration produces a specific interpretation of immigration as a process of long lasting settlement in a new country. Illegal immigration in this context is seen as extra undesirable as undocumented immigrants are temporary residents who lack an incentive to integrate.</p>
<p>Rita Verdonk, the Dutch minister of Immigration and Integration is a typical (maybe even iconic) example of the "rules are rules approach". In an opinion article in <em>de Volkskrant</em> she couples illegal immigration to terrorism. The terrorist attacks on New York and Madrid force the need for a strict immigration policy:</p>
<p>
Â </p>
<p> "â€¦ there are two requirements that may not be altered: the necessity to safeguard security and to further develop the European values. Since 9/11 and Madrid security is a main concern. This means that illegal immigration must be tackled even harder." (Verdonk 2004)</p>
<p>
Â </p>
<p>The second position is what I call the "humane approach". Illegal immigration is seen as an unwanted but unavoidable by-product of international immigration movements which are caused by the relative ease of global travelling and great differences in wealth. This approach stresses the positive consequences of immigration: immigrants are needed to compensate for the aging of Europe's population, they do the jobs that the natives no longer want to do, and the remittances which the immigrants send home are a kind of developmental aid that saves Europe from a lot of international problems. Proponents of this approach propose a more lax approach to undocumented immigrants. Offering more opportunities for work immigration, such as a Green Card system, is seen as a solution for the problem of undocumented immigrants. Proponents of this approach criticize the "rules are rules approach" for being to rigid. The situation of undocumented immigrants is too complicated to do justice with a strict interpretation of the rules. Although the methods may be illegal, the motives of many immigrants are honourable: they are "people trying to make the best of their lives", who flee poverty in order to find a better life in Europe. Enforcing the law may in many cases entail greater injustice. A typical remark by Willem Aantjes, a former politician and well know publicist:</p>
<p>
Â </p>
<p>"Rules are rules, but they must be implemented knowing that the greatest justice can lead to the greatest injustice when rigidly enforced. The letter kills, but the spirit gives life. This spirit is the center, the spirit from which rules are made and put into practice." (Aantjes 2006)</p>
<p>
Â </p>
<p>Usually both approaches are not discussed in abstract, but surface at discussions on specific issues. Some issues received special attention by the African churches. These were the discussion on the general pardon for 26.000 asylum seekers, the financial bonus that Minister Verdonk gives for every undocumented immigrant that the police catches, the comparison of the immigration policy with the way the Jews were treated during World War II by a member of Parliament, and the treatment of undocumented immigrants in detention centers, especially the keeping of children in captivity. These issues were discussed in African churches even before they became an issue in the public debate.</p>
<p>
Â </p>
<p><em>African churches and the public sphere<br />
</em></p>
<p>The African churches I studied fit in the "humane approach". When asked on the subject, they oppose the strict policy towards undocumented immigrants and propose a more lenient, "humane approach". Western countries should share their riches with the world and offer people who are willing to work the opportunity to do so. Reverend Marfo, a Pentecostal minister who is strongly involved in the issue of illegality, says the following:</p>
<p>
Â </p>
<p>"If people are working well and paying tax and looking after their family, then on the basis of their work they should be given a final status. â€¦ that will be good for the nation and good for the people concerned" (Rev. Tom Marfo, quoted in: Bakker 2005)</p>
<p>
Â </p>
<p>Africans usually do not attach the same weight to papers as native Dutch people do: legal papers cannot define who you are and whether you have the right to stay. Gerard Timmermans, a Dutch Roman Catholic priest, described the African attitude towards residence permits as: "Being illegal is for Africans like having no fishing permit for the Dutch." Many Dutch do not think that fishing without permit is a big evil. A fishing permit is something you buy mainly to avoid getting problems with the police when checked. Africans follow the same reasoning: not having the right residence papers is a practical problem, not a moral one.</p>
<p>The African churches use theological sources to support their plea for a "humane approach". They acknowledge the "God-given" right of a government to control who may go into the country, but they also think that the bible offers directions as to how governments should treat the people within its borders. Reverend Amoah of the Wesley Methodist Church thinks that the Dutch government should "share their riches" and leave "grain at the field" (Ruth 2:2) that can be picked up by poor (illegal) immigrants.</p>
<p>
Â </p>
<p>"The Dutch have every right to secure their border, but please, they should have a humanitarian approach, a kind attitude towards their fellow human beings." (Rev. Stephen Amoah).</p>
<p>
Â </p>
<p>That Amoah quotes from the book of Ruth is no coincidence: the story is about the poor immigrant Ruth and serves as an exemplary humanitarian policy to immigrants that the Dutch government should adopt. Another bible place that I heard being quoted is Matt. 25 (about the feeding of the hungry and the visiting of imprisoned people) [other sources??]. Another theological argument is that God is beyond human borders. According to Reverend Dube of the African Episcopal Methodist Church "the children of God are never and nowhere illegal," (Rev. Msizi Dube, quoted in: Christenen in Contact 2006) meaning that illegality is a construction that is alien to the mind of God.</p>
<p>Many African pastors are very critical about how the police try to find undocumented immigrants. They have first hand experience of how policy decisions work out in practice for undocumented immigrants. In the churches one can hear stories about Africans who fleeing from the police jumped of balconies and got injured. Pastor Marfo calls the "raids" on undocumented "evil attacks". The treatment of undocumented immigrants after they have been caught also receives strong criticisms: some pastors even call the detention centers (the official name for places where undocumented immigrants are kept) "deportation centers". They deliberately refer to the way the Jews were treated during World War II, in a similar manner as the Dutch Member of Parliament I mentioned before. Some native Dutch churches are also critical of the immigration policies of the government, but according to Rev. Dube, these churches have come to close to the government and have left their critical distance:</p>
<p>
Â </p>
<p>"As churches and supporting groups, we've become dependent on the government. We've become paralysed. We have to do the things that fit the agenda of the government and thus not use money to help undocumented immigrants." (quoted in: Christenen in Contact 2006)</p>
<p>
Â </p>
<p>African immigrant churches thus have their own ideas on illegal immigration. But do their ideas and argumentations reach the public sphere? Generally they do not. Although African churches are very tightly connected to the issue, their voice is not often heard in the public debates on illegal immigration. There are a few African pastors that have a strong public profile on this issue, but most of the churches only offer practical, informal help to people in need. The research that I conducted until now, suggest that this limited participation has to do with a number of things.</p>
<p>First of all there are internal circumstances that hinder participation by African churches. Many of the churches are very new, consisting of people who have come to the Netherlands only very recently. Even the leaders of these churches often are first generation immigrants. Most of the churches are still busy solving all kinds of practical problems, such as finding decent worship space. They have neither time nor opportunity to participate in the public sphere. Because of their relative short time in the Netherlands it is difficult for Africans (and of course for other immigrants too) to understand the "rules of the game". To really effectively play any game, one needs to know the rules and the other players from inside out. According to one Ghanaian pastor he and his colleagues often had to take recourse to doing things the "Ghanaian way", as they had insufficient knowledge of the Dutch way. Some African churches furthermore have a theology that makes it difficult to see issues as problems that need to be addressed in public. For example prosperity-gospel, an influential strand of Pentecostalism in African churches, teaches that well being (or the lack thereof) has to do with the faith of the individual believer. Poverty and misfortune have to be dealt with prayer and spiritual warfare instead of discussions and media pressure.</p>
<p>A second reason for the limited participation in the public sphere has to do with external hindrances. Other participants may simply overlook the existence of African churches, even when they try to take part in the public debate. For example, the media â€“ who are very influential in shaping any public debate â€“ do not often select African pastors as participants in debates on TV or radio. The debating ground already is covered by whole lot of (native Dutch) publicists, NGO's like <em>Vluchtelingenwerk</em> ("Work for Refugees"), politicians etc. There is furthermore evidence that African churches experience intercultural incompetence or even outright racism from Dutch people. For example, in a case study on the building of a church building for Ghanaian churches (Goossen 2006) the researcher discovered that the Dutch people involved in the building project (e.g. government officials, advisors, architects) thought very lowly of the intellectual capacities of Africans. This attitude probably still influences the willingness of Dutch participants to open up their debates to input from African churches.</p>
<p>The pastors Marfo and Dube are exceptions to the rule that African pastors do not have a strong public profile. Both are easily found by journalists and give interviews for radio, TV, newspapers, and are in contact with politicians. Marfo repeatedly went to parliament to speak to politicians and once invited a delegation of the Christian democratic members of parliament in his church. That these pastors have a public profile is related to their backgrounds. Marfo was raised in England and received a large part of his education there. [checken] Marfo is someone "who knows the system from inside out". Dube on the other hand has a background in South African liberation theology. He is trained to define issues as social structural problems that need to be addressed by changing public policy. Dube and Marfo demonstrate that "knowing how things work" and having the cultural capital to deal with the Dutch context is a prerequisite for an effective public participation. A public profile asks for an investment of time and energy that not all pastors and members of African churches are prepared to give. Some shun public exposure on the issue, because illegal immigration is associated with crime or because they are undocumented themselves. Others have been disappointed, for example a Baptist minister used to give interviews to AT5, the Amsterdam local TV-channel, but stopped doing it after a while "because nothing changed." Even the most public pastors acknowledge that getting your message abroad can be a difficult and possibly disappointing process.</p>
<p>
Â </p>
<p><em>Conclusions<br />
</em></p>
<p>Summarizing, I think that African churches contribute two elements to the debate that are not brought in by other participants. First of all many Africans do not acknowledge the fundamental importance of formal papers and procedures. Instead they stress that other moral values, such as the biblical instruction "to share the riches", should be taken into account. Statements like "being illegal is like fishing without permit" offer a relativization [wijzigen] of some axioms that are rarely discussed or criticized. Especially in the "rules are rules" discourse it is taken for granted that a correct handling of papers and procedures can be the touchstone of a just policy. But people who experience the enactment of policies see the moral dilemmas and problems that this (and probably any) policy produces. This makes it clear that the justness of a policy might not be easy to establish on formal grounds only. The position of African churches offers some clues as to what other grounds may help to promote a just immigration policy. A second element is the fact that their arguments are based on first hand experience. It is not just that Africans have another view of things, they are also uniquely located in the issue of illegal immigration: at the receiving end of immigration policy. Most of the participants in the debate depart from the viewpoint of the established: they argue which policy is best for the people who already are in the Netherlands. African churches argue more from the viewpoint of the outsiders: how do undocumented migrants think about the immigration policies? The African churches bring a perspective into the debate that generally is, but should not be ignored.</p>
<p>Although the African churches have something to add to the public debate, it is doubtful whether their contribution fully reaches the public sphere. In theory the public sphere is a place where all participants participate equally, but it is clear from the above that not every one has equal access. The persons most affected by policy decisions â€“ the undocumented migrants â€“ are the least able to publicly voice their interests. The African churches cannot effectively represent the interests of undocumented migrants either, because of the above mentioned internal and external problems of access to the public sphere. This unequal access threatens the very core of the public sphere: its publicness. This raises the question how the participation of African churches on the debate on illegal immigration and other future debates can be improved. I cannot go into practical details, as this would bring us too far beyond the reach of my empirical research, but I think that a good solution will be found somewhere along the lines of participation as a two way process.</p>
<p>Participants having limited access to the public sphere are a problem of both sides, so to solve it both sides must give and take a little. I once heard an African Baptist minister say in a sermon: "We have to educate ourselves, if we want to be successful in this society". This is not only true for 'normal' education, but also for <em>education in citizenship</em>. African churches cannot ignore the public sphere if they really want to solve some of the problems they encounter. This in particular is the case with illegal immigration. This issue is strongly influenced by policy decisions, so it might be a good idea for African churches to invest in learning how the system works, to try to improve their relations with the media and to train the skills necessary for public performance.</p>
<p>One of the main things the other participants should have is <em>patience</em>. As mentioned, African churches are still young. In the literature it is clear that the age of a church and the numbers of years its membership has lived in the host country is one of the strongest factors influencing participation. With time, churches get embedded in the system. So some problems will solve itself. Another thing participants can do is <em>translation</em>. This idea comes from an article by JÃ¼rgen Habermas, <em>Religion in the Public Sphere</em> (2006). Habermas argues that participants in the public sphere have the obligation to try to understand partners who not yet participate fully and to make their viewpoints publicly available. I do not agree with some of the arguments in the article, but Habermas' point of the obligation of translation I consider very valuable. Some of the hindrances to a really public sphere can only be solved by a cooperative effort of all participants. Patience, translation and education for citizenship are points of departure for a true two way participation that hopefully will produce an immigration policy which takes into account the whole range of moral considerations surrounding the issue of illegal immigration.</p>
