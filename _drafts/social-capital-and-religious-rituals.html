<p>I am busy rethinking the theoretical basis of my dissertation. I've been reading (and rereading) some books and articles with a few specific questions in my mind, which I need to answer in order to write the concluding chapters. I would like to discuss with you one of these question, in order to sharpen my thinking with your critical (please be!) comments.</p>
<p>The question I want to explore is the following: <em>"what is the relationship between religious ritual, social capital and moral behavior?".</em> I will first tell something about how I came initially to this question. Then I'll say something about what I've found in literature about this question. I will specifically focus on research done by René Bekkers, a dutch sociologist who researches the relation between charity and religion, and on a book written by Christian Scharen, <em>Public Worship and Public Work</em> in which the author tries to relate worshipservices of churches and their public work. I will end with formulating a few questions and loose-ended answers, which I hope you will react on.</p>
<p>I assume that people know what I mean with "moral behavior" and "religious ritual" -- in this article I will use a common sense definition of these termes. As for "social capital", for clarity's sake I will give, without further explanation, a provisional definition:
<dl>
<dt>social capital</dt>
<dd>the capital that 'inheres' in social structures, networks or relations between people (see Coleman, 1988 and Greeley, 2001).  To give an example: an 'old boys network' is a form of social capital for participants in the networkas as it provides easy access to important information</dd>
</dl>
<h4>Observations </h4>
<p>Because of several observations during my fieldwork I began to wonder about the relation between social capital and religious rituals. It seemed to me that especially religious rituals bring about social capital by bonding people into a community in a way that affects their emotions and their motivation to act in a certain way, their 'morality'. Let me give you two examples of this.</p>
<p>During my fieldwork I followed an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_course">alpha course</a>. In this course there were two occassions on which prayer played a central role. On the first occassion a young couple who lived together without being married, decided to marry. This happened after they had several discussions with other group members about this issue. They defended their position at first, but during a prayer meeting they suddenly changed their minds. This prayer moment was afterwards described by the group members, including the couple, as "beautiful", a "miracle wrought by the Spirit" and even "holy".<br />
The other occassion was during an evening about prayer, in which the group started to practice praying for each other. This evening was very emotional and "open" -- some people told very personal things that had never been discussed in earlier evenings or even with other people than close relatives. During this occassion the shift from having a discussion about one's faith to <em>sharing</em> very personal things was litterally brought about by prayer. The sharing began at the very moment that the prayer was started.</p>
<p>In my opinion these two occasions were two important moments in a longer process of the formation of social capital. During the course the participants developed a level of trust in eachother, some of the participants became friends or deepened their already existing friendship, and all of the members had a feeling that they shared something 'special' with the other participants. Furthermore, this process had an impact on the moral behavior of some of the participants (the couple). Other participants reported a deepening of their faith and their commitment to live as a christian.</p>
<p>To summarize, this group of people developed into a network with several elements that point to the existence of social capital. Religious ritual played a central role in the formation of social capital and had an influence on the moral behavior of the participants.</p>
<h4>Literature </h4>
<p>I am not the first who gives attention to the relation between religous ritual, social capital and moral behavior. One reason why I became intrigued by this subject were earlier studies on social capital or similar concepts (e.g. community, social structure) by Bourdieu and Durkheim and especially by René Bekkers. On the work of this last sociologist I want to focus a little sharper. Bekkers discovered in several quantitative studies a strong correlation between 'ritual behavior' (in this case going to church regularly) and 'moral behavior'. One of the findings of Bekkers is that regular church goers significantly give more money to charitative organisations and devote more time to volunteering than non church goers (Several of the articles of René Bekkers are available on his <a href="http://religionresearch.org/weblink/goto/16">website</a>. Earlier I wrote a review (sorry, Dutch only) of his work. You can find it <a href="http://religionresearch.org/node/view/15">here</a>).</p>
<p>The question is: why is it that this type of ritual behaviour has these consequences? In his latest article on the subject (Bekkers, 2003) Bekkers states that it is both an effect of churches being a network which brings regular church goers in contact with opportunities to do 'good works' (volunteering, writing letters for Amnesty International etc.) and an effect of the (moral) message that is being communicated in the church, e.g. the type of message influences to what noble cause regular church goers devote their time and money. Bekkers shows there exists a connection between moral behavior and religious ritual, but he only goes as far as saying that both elements are important. The question remains what exactly the interaction between those two elements is. How does ritual behavior bring about moral behavior?</p>
<p>At this point I want to bring into the discussion another book, called <em>Public worship and Public Work</em>. The author, Christian Scharen tries to evaluate the relation between Christian worship and the public works of Christian -- thus, rephrasing, the relation between ritual behavior and moral behavior. Scharen has an interesting solution: he uses Bourdieu's concept of <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitus">habitus</a></em> to understand this relation.</p>
<p>Scharen's basic question is whether Christian worship (as in worshipservices) forms "a people committed to the good of the broader public life." (10) In the book he criticizes several ethical theories for making too direct a link between worship and moral behavior. In this view individual worshippers are personally energized to act in a moral way by the worship service. The alternative Scharen proposes is informed by  Bourdieu's concept of habitus. According to Scharen there is a indirect link between worship and moral behavior: worship forms a group of believers who develop a moral habitus. It is the continuous confrontation in worship with a moral message that makes that people begin to act in a certain way. Moreover, the fact that this happens within a community strenghtens the development of a habitus: the group enforces, defines and legitimizes [my words] a moral code which group members have to follow.</p>
<p>To summarize, Bekkers shows <em>the fact</em> of the connection between ritual and moral behavior. The theory of Scharen adds to this <em>the how</em> of this connection: it is the group who helps to develop a moral habitus. But, the question remains: is there an explanation for this? Can we say something about <em>the why?</em>.</p>
<h4>Stitching it together</h4>
<p>Well, Scharen says a little more that can help to understand why ritual and moral behavior are connected. In his view public worship is a kind of model for public work. He uses the example of the Eucharist: as people learn to share the bread in worship, they learn to share 'bread' in public life.</p>
