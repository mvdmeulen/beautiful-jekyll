<h3>Last but not least</h3>
<p>A large part of my life is devoted to my wife and two daughters, with whom I live happily in a large house in a small village, with a beautiful view on the typical landscape of a Dutch polder. We bought this house together with friends, with the intention to provide space for the good life: friendship, music, art and taking care of other people. My family and I regularly attend the mainline local Reformed congregation. I furthermore like reading (from science fiction to literature to books on the relation of science and theology), playing piano, listening to music, to write posts on my weblogs or to tinker with computers.</p>
