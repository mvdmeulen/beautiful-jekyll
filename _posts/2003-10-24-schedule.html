<p>I have recently finished my fieldwork in the newly built suburb of Leidsche Rijn. Unfortunately, you will find little about it here because of the confidentiality of the 'raw data' of my research. My dissertation is scheduled to be published somewhere half way 2005. Probably before that date I will have written one or two articles.</p>
