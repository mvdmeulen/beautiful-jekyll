<p>''An interesting expression of the kind of interaction tonus that lies behind the proper managment of personal appearance is found in the constant care exerted by men in our society to see that their trousers are buttoned and that an erection bulge is not showing. The difficulty of engaging in this kind of protective concealment is one of the contingencies apparently faced by men with leg paralysis.'' p. 58, Ervin Goffman, <i>Behavior in Public Places</i>, Free Press, London, 1963.</p>
