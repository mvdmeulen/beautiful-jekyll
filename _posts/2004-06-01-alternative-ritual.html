<p>On the fringes of evangelicalism you see the so called <a href="http://www.alternativeworship.org">alternative worship</a> and <a href="http://www.opensourcetheology.net">emerging church</a> movement, two separate, but connected movements.  This website <a href="">small ritual</a> belongs to one or both of the movements -- i don't know yet. Interesting about it is that, apparently, the author of the site, went to glastonbury, a famous village in the UK with several New Age shops, and a New Age festival. See <a href="http://www.btinternet.com/%7Esmallritual/photo_glastonbury.html">here</a> for photographs from small ritual.<br />

And where did I hear this before: <a href="http://www.btinternet.com/%7Esmallritual/mountains.html">the spirituality of snowboarding</a>? I believe I might have heard this man, Neill Elliot, at a conference of Sociologists of Religion in Birmingham a few years ago. But i'm not sure.</p>
<p>Another example of the deeper meaning of linking...</p>
