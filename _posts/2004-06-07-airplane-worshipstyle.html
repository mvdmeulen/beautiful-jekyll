<blockquote>everyone faces the same way while someone faces them and waves their hands mysteriously while reciting instructions on what to do if there's a crash.</p></blockquote>
<p>Indeed a good description of what church services would look like a non-regular churchgoer. Quote from Heretics Corner: <a href="http://hereticscorner.typepad.com/the_heretics_corner/2004/04/questions_for_e.html">Questions for Emerging Church Folk</a>.</p>
<p>And of course, the <a href="http://www.emergingchurch.org">Emerging Church</a> does it entirely differently, don't they?</p>
