<p>This is interesting: you can let <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> search for definitions by adding "define:" to the word you want to define. I, for example, found this definition of schema with "define:schema":<br />
<blockquote>an internal representation of the world; an organization of concepts and actions that can be revised by new information about the world </p></blockquote>
<p>Off topic: Why would I want to know about the definition of "schema", you might wonder? That is because the people of <a href="http://www.religionresearch.org">religionresearch.org</a> discussed the usefulness of the concept for understanding human, religious behaviour, see <a href="http://religionresearch.org/node/view/171">here</a>.  Very interesting, check it out, although it is for Dutch speakers only (sorry...)</p>
