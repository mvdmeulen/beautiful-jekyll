<p>Vandaag voor het eerst <i>geluisterd</i> naar een lied dat ik al vaker gehoord heb, maar, blijkbaar, nog nooit op waarde heb geschat: het lied "Forbidden Fruit", uitgevoerd door Nina Simone (van "The Best of Nina Simone", 1992). Een citaat als <i>teaser</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The lord made eve adam’s madam have his kids and all<br />
Placed some labour laws on adam and he made the snake to fall<br />
Ever since the days of eden folks been sinful my<br />
Nowadays they’re even eating apples in their pie</p></blockquote>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>En de volledige tekst:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Eve and adam had a garden everything was great<br />
Till one day a boy says pardon miss my name is snake<br />
See that apple over yonder if you’ll take a bite<br />
You and adam both are bound to have some fun tonight<br />
Go on and eat forbidden fruit<br />
It’s mighty sweet forbidden fruit<br />
It’s quite a treat forbidden fruit<br />
Go ahead and taste it you don’t wanna waste it</p>
<p>The lord had said in the beginning everything is free<br />
Except that apple that leads to sinning so let that apple be<br />
But eve got tempted so she tried it and as all chicks do<br />
Teaser her man till he decided he’d just try some too<br />
Go on and eat forbidden fruit<br />
It’s mighty sweet forbidden fruit<br />
It’s quite a treat forbidden fruit<br />
Go ahead and bite it I bet you’d be delighted</p>
<p>I hate to tell you all what followed the lord was most upset<br />
Saw them making love and hollered what have you to add<br />
And when they made a full confession the lord said hm I see<br />
I guess I’ll have to teach you a lesson about not minding me<br />
Go on and eat forbidden fruit<br />
It’s mighty sweet forbidden fruit<br />
It’s quite a treat forbidden fruit<br />
You’re all indebted now you gonna get it</p>
<p>The lord made eve adam’s madam have his kids and all<br />
Placed some labour laws on adam and he made the snake to fall<br />
Ever since the days of eden folks been sinful my<br />
Nowadays they’re even eating apples in their pie<br />
Go on and eat forbidden fruit<br />
It’s mighty sweet forbidden fruit<br />
It’s quite a treat forbidden fruit<br />
Go ahead and taste it you don’t wanna waste it<br />
Oh go ahead and bite it I bet you’d be delighted<br />
You always did it now you’ll gonna get it<br />
Forbidden fruit
</p></blockquote></p>
