<p>As you might have noticed I have designed a new lay-out for marten.religionresearch.org. If you're a Internet Explorer user you might not like the new layout -- IE screws up the design. Probably because IE doesn't comply with CSS and XHTML standards. <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox">Mozilla Firefox</a> displays everything very nice. </p>
<p>So you have 2 options:
<ul>
<li>download Firefox and start using a real browser (hehe)
</li>
<li>have patience till i solved all problems.</li>
</ul>
<p>You think i'm overreacting, eh? Read <a>the IE Factor</a>, an article by <a href="http://www.stopdesign.com">Stopdesign</a>, the g(irl)(uy)(s) who wrote several of the (truly beautiful) default designs for <a href="http://www.blogger.com">Blogger</a></p>
