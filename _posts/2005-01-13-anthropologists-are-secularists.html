<p>I am reading the book <em>For the Glory of God. How Monotheism led to reformations, science, witch-hunts, and the end of slavery</em>. In this book Stark tries to debunk several theories that state that religion has a bad influence on science, morality and rationality in general. Especially the chapter on religion and science is interesting, and sometimes outright hilarious. According to Stark the idea that religion is bad for science has been proposed as a part of an ideological campaign against religion by 'Englightened' philosophers and scientists. In reality,  science has often benefited from religion.<br />

Moreover, Stark holds that especially the Christian view that God is a rational being Whose works can be known by reason and empirical research, was an important influence on the progress of science in Europe. Stark presents figures that a large majority of the early scientists of the so-called Scientific Revolution of the 16th century were devout Christians, protestants and roman catholics alike.  And he shows that this pattern continues in up till this day. In several surveys on the religiosity of scientists,  scientists consistently are as religious as the general population - with one exeception: social scientists, and especially anthropologist are substantially less religious. While 60% of the scientists in mathematics and physical sciences report they are religious, only 29% of the anthropologist do the same. The full figure can be found in the book on p. 194, or online <a href="http://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/001419.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>In the book Stark gives no explanation to the fact that social scientist are much more prone to secularism, but in another article he does. In the American Economic Review, May 1996,  he states the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are inclined to side with Wuthnow ..., who argues that the social sciences lean toward irreligion precisely because they are 'the <em>least scientific</em> disciplines.' Their semi-religious reliance on non-testable claims [he means secularization theory and the 'doctrine' of the incompatibility of religion and science] puts them in direct competition with traditional religions.</p></blockquote>
<p>A bold claim, but understandable, and possibly, i am beginning to believe by reading his new book, <em>true</em>.</p>
