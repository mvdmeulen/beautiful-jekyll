<p>Found this while surfing: <a href="http://www.instantdegrees.com">www.instantdegrees.com</a>. From their site:</p>
<blockquote><p>

<p>I'm now busy writing the last chapter of my dissertation. After years of hard work, i finally discover I could have done it in days! Prices starting from $100,- !  At first I was a little critical, but then I read this in their FAQ:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<b>Critics [= people who <em>did</em> study for their degree]. Why you should ignore them</b><br />
.... These are people who have frittered away years in classrooms absorbing blindly and thoughtlessly second hand information in a theoretical environment completely removed from real life, and for what? In order to acquire the right to use the same Title or post-nominal letters that you can legally acquire in a matter of days for the price a meal in a decent restaurant.

<p>That's me they're describing! Gash, I must learn to prioritize better...</p>
