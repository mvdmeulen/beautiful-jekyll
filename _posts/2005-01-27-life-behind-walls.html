<blockquote><p>In the wake of Iran's Islamic Revolution, Marjane Satrapi's middle-class parents sent her to boarding school in Vienna. Satrapi returned to Iran in the mid-1980s, as the country continued to fight a bloody war with Iraq. By 1989 she had enrolled in the art program at Iran's state university.
