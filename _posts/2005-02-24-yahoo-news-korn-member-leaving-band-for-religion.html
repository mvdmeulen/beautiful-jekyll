<p>Brian Welch, gitarist van Korn, duistere eh... tja ik ben te oud om ze in het juiste vakje te plaatsen... noem het maar metalband, is tot geloof gekomen.</p>
<p>Citaat van <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&#038;u=/ap/20050224/ap_en_mu/music_korn">Yahoo! News</a>:<br />
<blockquote>"Those guys in the band, they're not bad guys. They're just a bunch of kids getting marketed how these guys in the big corporate firms want to do," Welch said. "It makes us look like bad people, but we're really just a bunch of kids who never had a chance to grow up."</p></blockquote>
