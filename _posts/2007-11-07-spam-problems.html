<p>Don't leave a blog unattended, when you return to it you'll find it infested with spam. That's what I learned when I returned to Forum Fridinum recently. I am working on cleaning the blog. In the meantime, if you want to comment on my posts, <a href="http://religionresearch.org/wp-signup.php">please register here</a>Â  (either with or without a blog at RR.org).</p>
