<p><a href="http://www.ssrc.org/blogs/immanent_frame/2008/02/23/beyond-the-god-delusion/">Elaine Howard Ecklund published an interesting blogpost on the religiosity of scientists on SSRC's <em>The Immanent Frame </em>weblog.</a> The post is based on research she already has published about in Social Problems (54:2, 2007). She however does not talk about her research findings too much, but instead argues how universities could better facilitate the public discussion on religion and science. A must read for anyone interested in religion, which probably involves all of you who made it here and read this post ;-) And of course congratulations to Elaine about being asked to publish on such a prestigious weblog.</p>
<p>For those really interested: I had an interesting discussion two years ago on this subject here: <a href="http://religionresearch.org/marten/2005/01/13/anthropologists-are-secularists/" rel="nofollow">http://religionresearch.org/marten/2005/01/13/anthropologists-are-secularists/</a> and here <a href="http://religionresearch.org/marten/2005/01/14/real-scientists-also-secular-or-not/" rel="nofollow">http://religionresearch.org/marten/2005/01/14/real-scientists-also-secular-or-not/</a></p>
