<p>Gerardo Marti, author of <em>A Mosaic of Believers </em>and <em>Hollywood Faith, </em>and upcoming recognized expert on all things evangelical has started a weblog. Gerardo once confided to me he had been an evangelical pastor (in the church he describes in <em>Mosaic) and </em>had read several European theologians like Karl Barth and Bonhoeffer -- that alone would have triggered my interest in his weblog, but he also happens to be an an excellent sociologist of religion. So this is a must follow.</p>
