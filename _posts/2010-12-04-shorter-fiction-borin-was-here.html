<p>Borin quickly wrote this poem on a standing stone:<br />
"Borin was here,<br />
he now is o'erthere<br />
--&gt;"<br />
The brown predator that came a minute later could not read,<br />
a slight, but deadly oversight in Borin's perfect plan.<br />
In his final moments Borin could not stop this rhyme from popping up:<br />
"Borin was here,<br />
how appropriate the past tense now is, bear"</p>
