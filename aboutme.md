# Current research

At the moment (2018) I work at the Protestant Theological University in Groningen, the Netherlands. I am involved in different researches, most of them associated with research platform [Connecting Churches and Cultures](http://pthu.nl/ccc)

# Older research

From 2005 – 2010 I worked as a postdoc at the [VU University](http://www.vu.nl), studying migrant churches in Amsterdam.

In June 2006 I finished a PhD study titled “Vroom in de Vinex. Kerk en civil society in Leidsche Rijn” (“Faith in the Suburb. Church and Civil Society in Leidsche Rijn”). My research is based on (mostly) etnographic fieldwork in Leidsche Rijn, the largest new VINEX building project in the Netherlands. During the year 2002 I followed two church-building projects, an ecumenical project called “Being Church in Leidsche Rijn” and a conservative reformed project, called RijnWaarde.
